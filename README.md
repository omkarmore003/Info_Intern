Project Title:
AI-Driven Supply Chain Disruption Predictor and Inventory Optimization System

Project Overview:
This project aims to revolutionize supply chain management through the development of an advanced AI-powered system. The solution monitors global supply chain data, predicts potential disruptions, and optimizes inventory levels dynamically. It integrates natural language processing (NLP), machine learning, and ERP systems, providing businesses with real-time insights, risk management tools, and inventory recommendations to maintain operational continuity.

Goals and Objectives:
1.	Predict Supply Chain Disruptions:
o	Leverage NLP and machine learning to analyze data from news, supplier information, and transportation trends.
o	Identify and quantify potential risks in the supply chain.
2.	Optimize Inventory Levels:
o	Dynamically adjust inventory levels based on risk predictions and demand.
o	Prevent overstocking and understocking to reduce losses and improve efficiency.
3.	Provide Real-Time Alerts and Integration:
o	Send critical alerts via Slack, Email, or other communication tools.
o	Integrate with ERP systems like SAP to automate inventory adjustments and reordering.
4.	Enhance Decision-Making and Operational Resilience:
o	Offer actionable insights through dashboards and predictive analytics.

Key Modules:
1. Global Data Monitoring and Analysis Engine
•	Functionality: 
o	Monitors global data sources, including news articles, supplier information, and logistics updates.
o	Uses NLP to extract relevant insights and detect trends impacting supply chains.
•	Technologies: 
o	OpenAI GPT, Meta LLaMA for NLP and text analysis.
o	APIs for real-time news and data aggregation.
2. Predictive Disruption Modeling System
•	Functionality: 
o	Utilizes machine learning models to forecast potential disruptions and their impact.
o	Generates risk scores and probability assessments for various scenarios.
•	Technologies: 
o	Machine learning frameworks like Scikit-learn or TensorFlow.
o	Features include delivery delays, order urgency, and transportation data.
3. ERP Integration and Inventory Adjustment Module
•	Functionality: 
o	Integrates seamlessly with ERP systems (e.g., SAP) to synchronize inventory data.
o	Recommends inventory adjustments and automates reordering processes.
•	Technologies: 
o	RESTful APIs for ERP integration.
o	Inventory optimization algorithms based on demand forecasts and disruption risks.
4. Real-Time Alert and Reporting Dashboard
   
•	Functionality: 
o	Delivers instant notifications of disruption risks and inventory adjustments via Slack or Email.
o	Provides comprehensive dashboards with visualizations of risks, predictions, and inventory status.
•	Technologies: 
o	Visualization tools like Tableau or Plotly.
o	Communication integrations using Slack and email APIs.

Expected Outcomes:
•	Accurate Prediction of Disruptions:
o	Improved forecasting of supply chain risks through data-driven insights.
•	Dynamic Inventory Optimization:
o	Significant reduction in overstocking and stockouts by adjusting inventory dynamically.
•	Real-Time Notifications:
o	Immediate alerts for decision-makers to act proactively.
•	Enhanced Efficiency and Resilience:
o	Reduction in supply chain-related losses and better preparedness for disruptions.
